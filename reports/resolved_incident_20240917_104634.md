        ## Incident Summary
        Hardware malfunction

        ## Resolution Status
        Resolved

        ## Resolution Steps
        
1. The potential root cause of the hardware malfunction could be due to multiple factors such as system overload, network connectivity issues, or hardware failures. The high CPU usage and low memory availability are indicators of potential system overload, while the offline or degraded status of the database server, network infrastructure, and storage system suggest hardware failures or connectivity issues.

2. Step-by-step resolution instructions:
- Identify the specific hardware component that is malfunctioning by checking the status of each system in the system overview.
- If the issue is with the network infrastructure, troubleshoot the network connectivity and resolve any issues.
- If the issue is with the database server or storage system, check for any hardware failures and replace the faulty components.
- If the CPU usage and memory availability are high, consider upgrading the hardware or optimizing the system to handle the workload.
- Once the specific hardware component is identified and resolved, restart the affected systems and monitor their performance.

3. To avoid similar issues in the future, it is important to regularly monitor the system health and address any potential issues before they escalate. This can be achieved by implementing proactive maintenance and monitoring practices, such as regular hardware checks, software updates, and load balancing. It is also recommended to have a backup system in place to minimize downtime in case
