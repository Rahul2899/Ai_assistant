1. The potential root cause for the degraded performance of the Application Server could be due to its high CPU usage. This could be caused by heavy workload, inefficient coding, or insufficient resources. The offline status of the Storage System may be due to a hardware failure, network connectivity issues, or a misconfiguration.

2. Step-by-step resolution instructions:

- For the Application Server:
    - Monitor the CPU usage and identify any specific processes or applications causing high CPU usage.
    - Optimize the code or resources of the problematic processes or applications.
    - If the high CPU usage persists, consider upgrading the server's resources or adding additional servers to handle the workload.
- For the Storage System:
    - Check the hardware for any failures and replace or repair as necessary.
    - Check for any network connectivity issues and troubleshoot as necessary.
    - Verify the configuration and make any necessary changes.
    - Restart the system if all other steps fail to resolve the issue.

3. To avoid similar issues in the future, it is important to regularly monitor and maintain the IT infrastructure. This includes:
    - Monitoring and optimizing resource usage to prevent overloading and potential performance issues.
    - Regularly checking and maintaining hardware and network connectivity to avoid failures and downtime.
