        Software installation issues

        ## Resolution Status
        Resolved

        ## Resolution Steps
        
1. The potential root cause of the software installation issues could be a combination of high resource usage and offline servers. The high CPU usage on the Database and Storage servers could be impacting the performance of the system, while the offline status of the Application server and Authentication service could be preventing the installation process from completing successfully.

2. Step-by-step resolution instructions:
- First, address the high CPU usage on the Database and Storage servers by investigating and optimizing any resource-intensive processes or applications.
- Next, troubleshoot and resolve the issues causing the Application server and Authentication service to be offline. This could involve restarting the servers, checking network connectivity, or addressing any underlying software or hardware issues.
- Once all servers are online and operating within acceptable levels, attempt the software installation again.

3. To avoid similar issues in the future, it is important to regularly monitor and maintain the health of the system. This can include setting up alerts for high resource usage, performing regular updates and maintenance tasks, and regularly checking for and addressing any potential issues before they escalate. Additionally, having a contingency plan in place for server failures or downtime can help minimize the impact on system functionality.
