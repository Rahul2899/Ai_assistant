        ## Incident Summary
        Hardware malfunction

        ## Resolution Status
        Unresolved

        ## Resolution Steps
        
1. The potential root cause for the hardware malfunction is likely due to the high CPU and memory usage on multiple servers, as well as the offline status of the authentication service and network infrastructure. This indicates that there may be a problem with the overall system configuration, leading to overload and degradation of various components.
2. To resolve this issue, the first step would be to investigate and address the high CPU and memory usage on the application, web, and database servers. This could involve optimizing the code, increasing server resources, or identifying and addressing any underlying issues causing the high usage. Next, the authentication service and network infrastructure need to be brought back online, potentially by troubleshooting network connections or addressing any server issues. Lastly, the high CPU usage on the storage system should be investigated and resolved, potentially by optimizing storage settings or upgrading hardware. 
3. To prevent similar issues in the future, regular monitoring and maintenance of the system should be implemented. This could involve setting up alerts for high resource usage, regularly checking and optimizing server configurations, and implementing redundancy and failover measures for critical components. Additionally, implementing a disaster recovery plan and regularly backing up data can help mitigate the impact of any potential hardware malfunctions.
