        ## Resolution Steps
        
    1. The potential root cause of the issue is likely due to high usage on the application and web servers, as well as the database server. This could be caused by a spike in traffic or an increase in demand for resources from these servers. Additionally, the offline status of the authentication service and network infrastructure could also be contributing to the overall degraded system health.
    
    2. To resolve this issue, the first step would be to investigate and address the high usage on the application and web servers. This could involve optimizing code, increasing server resources, or scaling up the infrastructure. The database server should also be checked and optimized to improve its performance. The authentication service and network infrastructure should be brought back online as soon as possible to restore their functionality. Finally, the high CPU usage on the storage system should be addressed by optimizing its configuration or scaling up the infrastructure.
    
    3. To prevent similar issues in the future, it would be beneficial to regularly monitor and optimize the resources and performance of all servers and services. This could involve implementing automated scaling processes to handle spikes in traffic or demand for resources. Additionally, implementing redundancy and failover systems for critical services such as the authentication service and network infrastructure can help prevent complete outages. Regular maintenance and updates
